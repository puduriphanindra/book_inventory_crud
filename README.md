## Installing dependencies

We are going to install dependencies for our NodeJS Before that, npm init -y can be used to set up a new or existing npm package. A package.json file will be created.

## Production dependencies

Production dependencies are normal dependencies that are mandatory for running the project.

We need:

express
mongodb
ejs
To Install packages: npm i express mongodb ejs

## Development Dependencies

Next are development dependencies, these are those dependencies which are needed at the time of development but are not responsible for working of the application i.e. even if we skip these dependency our application will work just fine. One such most common is nodemon which

npm i nodemon --save-dev
